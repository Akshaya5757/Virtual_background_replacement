Problem statement: 
Background removal and replacement is a fundamental problem in computer vision and image processing with applications in photography, video conferencing, augmented reality, and content creation. Traditional methods require manual segmentation or use chroma-keying (green screen), which is often inconvenient and expensive. Automated background segmentation aims to isolate the subject (usually a person) from the background without requiring special setups. However, achieving accurate and real-time segmentation is challenging due to variations in lighting, complex backgrounds, and diverse poses. Deep learning models have made significant progress but often require heavy computational resources and large datasets. MediaPipe’s Selfie Segmentation provides a lightweight, real-time solution for segmenting a person from the background using a pretrained model optimized for mobile and edge devices. The problem addressed in this project is how to effectively replace the background of a given image containing a person with a different background image using MediaPipe’s Selfie Segmentation, while maintaining high quality and smooth transitions. The solution should handle images with diverse backgrounds and produce visually appealing outputs. Abstract: Background removal and replacement in images is a widely sought-after technique in computer vision, enabling applications ranging from virtual conferencing and augmented reality to creative photo editing. Traditional methods often require controlled environments such as green screens or manual segmentation, which are time-consuming and costly. Recent advances in deep learning have made it possible to automate this process with high accuracy. This project leverages MediaPipe’s Selfie Segmentation, a lightweight and efficient pretrained model optimized for person segmentation, to isolate the subject in an image and replace the background with a custom image. By combining this segmentation output with OpenCV for image processing, the system generates visually convincing results with minimal computational overhead. The approach eliminates the need for complex setups or extensive user intervention, making background replacement accessible to a broader range of users and devices. The implementation involves processing an input image containing a person, generating a segmentation mask that identifies the foreground subject, and blending the original person with a new background image. The background is resized to match the person image dimensions to ensure seamless compositing. Alpha blending is applied to the segmentation mask to smooth edges and avoid harsh transitions, thereby improving the visual quality of the output. This method performs well under various lighting conditions and backgrounds, although challenges remain in handling fine details such as hair or semi-transparent regions. The project highlights the practical use of machine learning models in everyday multimedia applications and demonstrates how combining MediaPipe’s efficient segmentation with classical image processing techniques can deliver high-quality Introduction:

Background replacement is an essential task in modern multimedia applications, including

video conferencing, film production, and social media content creation. Traditionally,

achieving a clean background swap required a controlled environment with a uniform

background, like a green screen, and complex post-processing. With the advancement of

computer vision and machine learning, automated segmentation techniques have become

available to isolate humans from complex backgrounds in real time. Conclusion:

This project successfully demonstrates how MediaPipe Selfie Segmentation can be used to

automatically remove and replace the background of images containing people. The

solution provides a fast, effective, and user-friendly way to isolate the subject from complex

backgrounds and composite a new background seamlessly. The use of a pretrained,

lightweight model allows real-time or near-real-time processing on common hardware

without requiring specialized GPUs or extensive training data. The integration with

OpenCV facilitates image handling and visualization. While the method works well for

many scenarios, improvements can be made to better handle fine details and complex

backgrounds. Future work may include video processing, temporal smoothing, and

enhanced edge refinement techniques. Overall, this approach expands the capabilities of

image editing and virtual environments, offering significant potential for multimedia,

communication, and creative industries.
